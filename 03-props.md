# Props are used when we want to reuse a component with different data.

--> The props concept is all about being able to pass data into components.

--> When react calls a function component with props, it will pass them to the the component function.

--> That is why we can use the same function for the same components but with different data, because the data is defined on the props of each component.

--> It is an object.
