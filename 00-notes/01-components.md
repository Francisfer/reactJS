# Components are one of the core concepts when working with react.

--> This concept is needed for all react apps.

--> Components are potentially reusable building blocks that we can create and combine to build the overall user interface.

--> React apps are, in the end, build by combining components.

--> While concepts like jsx, props or state would be needed to create truly interactive user interfaces, components are the one concept that every react app will use.

--> Components allow us to break or split complex user interfaces into smaller, more manageable parts, which can potentially be reused in different places of the ui (cards for example or buttons).

## In react, a component is really just a javascript function.

--> To be recognized and used as a component by react, the function must follow two important rules:

-> The function name must start with an uppercase character.

-> The function must return a value that can be rendered.
